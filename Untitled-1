NETWORK 400 Group Project

Dynamic Routing Mechanism Design in Faulty Networks:
This team will simulate a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail 
intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node & link will have a certain probability to fail.
When such failures occur, the network must adapt & re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.

MESH NETWORKS:

- Can relay messages using either flooding technique or routing technique.
- Fixing itself using shortest path bridging.

MESH NETWORKS MESSAGE TECHNIQUES:

- flooding technique: Sending the message to each child which then sends the message to all its children.
    (can use ACK or non ACK type)
- routing technique: Is based on the multicast, unicast, ... and so on. This sounds like a form of porting 
    in which each node waits for a specific port call to then receive the message.

SOLVING PROBLEMS:

- Mesh networks don't connect dynamically and non-hierarchically
- Each node knows it's neighbor, so how would it know the shortest distance from one node to another?

THOUGHTS:

- Based on the SOAR article, they are using an opportunistic routing technique that doesn't calculate the final route at the beginning.
  Instead the nodes broadcast to their neighbor nodes to have them calculate and choose who are the best senders. Why not calculate the best route from the beginning,
  if at any point the next correct node does not seem to be reponding, restart the calculation from current node to final node.
